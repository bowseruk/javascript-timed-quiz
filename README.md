# Bootcamp Project 6 - Javascript Timed Quiz

## Description 

This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript to make a timed Javascript trivia game. The project had the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
